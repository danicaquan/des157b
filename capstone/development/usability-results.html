         <h2>Observations:</h2>
         <hr id="one">
         <ol>
             <li>Overall, navigating the website seemed pretty straightforward. The transition from the start screen to scrolling around the brick wall seemed quite intuitive and my testers didn't have much of a problem on getting around. Clicking on the bricks was also quite intuitive. They all eventually tried the 'Add One' button as well and seemed to understand what its purpose was.</li>
             <li>I noticed that it seemed like my users saw the add button as an 'after' aspect likely due to it's size in comparison to the rest of the page. This is indicitive of a problem I already knew was going to impact usbility because my page had not styling -- the styling of the page really impact the ease of use for the site. I also found that it was a little difficult for users to locate the brick you just added to the page because there is no marked difference and they don't know where it would appear.</li>
             <li>More directly, most of the feedback I got was in regards to adding more content. For example, adding more entry fields or prompts for the users to write about to gain a more complex and interesting understanding. The other main thing was to add more information about the background of the project: the seal, bricks, and purpose of the page.</li>

     <h2>Implementation:</h2>
     <hr id="two">
     <p> Truth to be told, my usability test was kind of under developed for my liking -- especially in regards to the visual design and the actual content. I was aware this would impact how my users interacted with the site and it was something I planned to work on. Much of the overall placement and function works fine; generally, my users could actually use the features. As I expected, much of the issues of my page resolves around styling and most of my feedback involved adding more content to the page. I will develop both further. Adding more graphical elements, larger font sizes, colors, and more will help with visual usability and make the page more engaging. I also plan on adding more information and links to other pages that talk about the seal, alongside developing the prompts on the form and information on the bricks more.</p> 
    <p>Regardless of whether or not I had anticipated these issues, getting other people's thoughts is very valuable as it helps confirm my thoughts. It helps me feel more reassured on what I should add that would help make my project more impactful.</p>
