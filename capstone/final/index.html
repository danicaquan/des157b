        <p>The Davis Centennial Seal is a 6.5 foot circular bronze seal installed in front of the Dresbach-Hunt-Boyer House at 604 Second St in downtown Davis. For further reference, this is near Mishka's Cafe. It was created in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 1917 incorporation of the city of Davis by the artist Susan Shelton. The seal's imagery celebrates and conveys the deep and complex history of Davis: from it's founding, notable historical events, landscape, and more. To learn more about the seal, it's influences, creation, and more, please visit this page.</p>

        <p>Alongside the seal, the city develop an adopt-a-brick program in order to help supplement the rest of the funding for the seal. Organizations or individuals can purchase an inlaid plaza brick with chosen inscriptions. The plaza includes space for more than 2,000 inscribed bricks. 100 historic bricks memorializing important figures who have died and large bricks for the 11 key donors were placed upon installation of the Seal.
